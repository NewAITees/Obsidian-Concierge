### 1. Code Quality
**Document: "Consistent Code Quality Standards"**

This section covers general best practices for maintaining high-quality code:

- **Consistent Style**: 
  - *What it means*: Follow uniform formatting and style conventions.
  - *How to implement*: Adhere to PEP 8 for Python and use automatic formatters.
  - *Example*: Configure pre-commit hooks with Black and isort.
  - *Why it matters*: Makes code more readable and reduces cognitive load.

- **Clear Naming Conventions**: 
  - *What it means*: Use names that reflect intentions for variables, functions, and classes.
  - *How to implement*: Choose descriptive names that explain purpose and behavior.
  - *Example*: Use `calculate_total_price` instead of `calc` or `process_data`.
  - *Why it matters*: Makes code self-documenting and easier to understand.

- **DRY Principle**: 
  - *What it means*: "Don't Repeat Yourself" - avoid duplicating code.
  - *How to implement*: Extract common functionality into shared functions or classes.
  - *Example*: Create a helper function for validation logic used in multiple places.
  - *Why it matters*: Reduces maintenance burden and potential for inconsistencies.

- **SOLID Principles**: 
  - *What it means*: Follow object-oriented design principles, especially Single Responsibility.
  - *How to implement*: Design classes with focused responsibilities and well-defined interfaces.
  - *Example*: Create separate classes for data access, business logic, and presentation.
  - *Why it matters*: Results in more maintainable, extensible, and testable code.
