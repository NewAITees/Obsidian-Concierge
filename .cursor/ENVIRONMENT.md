Mise en Plus

### 3. Mise en Plus (Preparation and Environment Setup)
**Document: "LLM Workspace Preparation Guide"**

This principle focuses on setting up the environment properly before working with LLMs:

- **Pre-configuration of Environment**: 
  - *What it means*: Prepare everything needed before starting LLM work.
  - *How to implement*: Set up all necessary tools, libraries, and configurations in advance.
  - *Example*: Configure API keys, rate limiting, and fallback mechanisms before development.
  - *Why it matters*: Prevents interruptions and ensures smooth development flow.

- **Ensuring Access to Resources**: 
  - *What it means*: Make sure LLMs can access all needed resources.
  - *How to implement*: Prepare files, APIs, and tools that the LLM might need to reference.
  - *Example*: Load relevant documentation into a vector database before asking LLM to answer questions about it.
  - *Why it matters*: Enables LLM to provide more accurate and contextual responses.

- **Standardization of Development Environment**: 
  - *What it means*: Create consistent environments for development.
  - *How to implement*: Use containers, virtual environments, or standardized cloud environments.
  - *Example*: Use Docker to define a consistent environment for all developers.
  - *Why it matters*: Ensures reproducible results across different machines and environments.

- **Error Handling Strategy**: 
  - *What it means*: Plan for how to handle LLM-related failures.
  - *How to implement*: Define fallback behaviors and error recovery mechanisms.
  - *Example*: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for API rate limits.
  - *Why it matters*: Makes applications resilient to LLM failures or limitations.
