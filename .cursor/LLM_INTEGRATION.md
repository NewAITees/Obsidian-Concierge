### 1. LLM Integration Architecture
**Document: "LLM Application Architecture Blueprint"**

This section covers how to structure applications that integrate with large language models:

- **Separation of Responsibilities**: 
  - *What it means*: Divide LLM-related code into distinct components.
  - *How to implement*: Create separate modules for prompt management, LLM calls, and response processing.
  - *Example*: Have a `PromptManager` class, an `LLMClient` class, and a `ResponseParser` class.
  - *Why it matters*: Makes the system more maintainable and easier to optimize or debug.

- **Model Abstraction**: 
  - *What it means*: Create interfaces that aren't tied to specific LLM implementations.
  - *How to implement*: Define abstract interfaces that various LLM providers can implement.
  - *Example*: Create an `LLMProvider` interface that could be implemented by `OpenAIProvider`, `AnthropicProvider`, etc.
  - *Why it matters*: Allows switching between different LLMs without changing application code.

- **Memory and Context Management**: 
  - *What it means*: Explicitly design how conversation history and context are managed.
  - *How to implement*: Create data structures and services to manage conversation state.
  - *Example*: Implement a `ConversationManager` that tracks chat history and manages context windows.
  - *Why it matters*: Ensures LLM has appropriate context for generating relevant responses.

- **MCP Server Utilization**: 
  - *What it means*: Use the Model Context Protocol for standardized agent capabilities.
  - *How to implement*: Integrate with MCP servers for complex agent functionality.
  - *Example*: Set up an MCP server to handle tool-using agents that can perform actions.
  - *Why it matters*: Provides a standardized way for LLMs to interact with external tools and systems.
