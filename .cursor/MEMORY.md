### 5. Memory and State Management
**Document: "LLM Context Management System"**

This principle addresses how to manage the limited context window of LLMs:

- **Addressing the Memento Problem**: 
  - *What it means*: Compensate for LLMs' limited memory capacity.
  - *How to implement*: Create explicit state management systems outside the LLM.
  - *Example*: Maintain a database of user preferences and conversation history that can be selectively loaded.
  - *Why it matters*: Allows applications to maintain context beyond LLM limitations.

- **Distinguishing Long and Short-Term Memory**: 
  - *What it means*: Treat different types of information with appropriate persistence.
  - *How to implement*: Use different storage mechanisms for temporary vs. permanent data.
  - *Example*: Store current conversation in memory but archive important insights to a database.
  - *Why it matters*: Ensures critical information persists while ephemeral details can be forgotten.

- **Conversation Context Optimization**: 
  - *What it means*: Maximize useful context within token limits.
  - *How to implement*: Prioritize and summarize information to fit within context windows.
  - *Example*: Summarize older parts of conversations while keeping recent exchanges verbatim.
  - *Why it matters*: Makes the most of limited context windows for better LLM performance.

- **State Persistence**: 
  - *What it means*: Maintain context across sessions.
  - *How to implement*: Save and load conversation state between user interactions.
  - *Example*: Save important facts about a user to a database and reload them in future sessions.
  - *Why it matters*: Creates continuity of experience across multiple interactions.
