### 5. Testing Strategy
**Document: "Comprehensive Testing Framework"**

Effective testing ensures your application works as expected:

- **Black Box Testing**: 
  - *What it means*: Test functionality without knowledge of internal implementation.
  - *How to implement*: Write tests that only interact with public interfaces.
  - *Example*: Test a user registration function by providing inputs and verifying the user was created correctly.
  - *Why it matters*: Ensures tests remain valid even when implementation details change.

- **Parameterized Tests**: 
  - *What it means*: Run the same test logic with multiple sets of inputs and expected outputs.
  - *How to implement*: Use testing frameworks' parameterization features (e.g., pytest's `@pytest.mark.parametrize`).
  - *Example*: 
    ```python
    @pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected", [
        ("123", 123),
        ("456", 456),
        ("invalid", ValueError),
    ])
    def test_parse_number(input, expected):
        if isinstance(expected, type) and issubclass(expected, Exception):
            with pytest.raises(expected):
                parse_number(input)
        else:
            assert parse_number(input) == expected
    ```
  - *Why it matters*: Tests multiple scenarios efficiently without duplicating code.

- **Scientific Debugging**: 
  - *What it means*: Use a systematic approach to find and fix bugs.
  - *How to implement*: Observe the issue, form a hypothesis, design an experiment, and test.
  - *Example*: If users report slow page loads, measure load times, hypothesize it's a database query, optimize the query, then verify improvement.
  - *Why it matters*: Makes debugging methodical rather than random guesswork.

- **Test Independence**: 
  - *What it means*: Each test should run without depending on other tests.
  - *How to implement*: Set up and tear down test environments for each test, avoid shared state.
  - *Example*: Use fresh database fixtures for each test instead of relying on data created by previous tests.
  - *Why it matters*: Prevents cascading test failures and makes it easier to run specific tests.
