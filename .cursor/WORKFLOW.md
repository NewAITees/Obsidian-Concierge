### 3. Development Flow Optimized for AI Assistance
**Document: "AI-Assisted Development Workflow Guide"**

These principles help you work effectively with AI coding assistants:

- **Addressing "Keep Digging" Problems**: 
  - *What it means*: Avoid getting stuck in implementation details without a clear plan.
  - *How to implement*: Outline your approach before coding, establish checkpoints to reassess.
  - *Example*: Before implementing a complex feature, write out the steps and data flow.
  - *Why it matters*: Prevents going down rabbit holes and helps AI tools understand your goals.

- **Refactor First**: 
  - *What it means*: Clean up existing code before adding new features.
  - *How to implement*: Identify and fix code smells, improve naming, and structure before extensions.
  - *Example*: Before adding a new API endpoint, refactor related code to be more modular.
  - *Why it matters*: Makes changes easier to implement and helps AI understand the codebase better.

- **Apply the "Rule of Three"**: 
  - *What it means*: When you see the same code pattern three times, it's time to refactor.
  - *How to implement*: Extract repeated code into reusable functions, classes, or components.
  - *Example*: If you have similar validation logic in three places, create a shared validation function.
  - *Why it matters*: Reduces duplication, making code more maintainable and consistent.

- **Utilize Automatic Formatting**: 
  - *What it means*: Use tools to automatically format your code.
  - *How to implement*: Set up tools like `black`, `isort`, or `prettier` in your project.
  - *Example*: Add pre-commit hooks that run these formatters before commits.
  - *Why it matters*: Maintains consistent style without manual effort and reduces AI confusion.
