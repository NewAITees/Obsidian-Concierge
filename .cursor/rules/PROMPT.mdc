### 2. Prompt Engineering
**Document: "Versioned Prompt Design System"**

This principle covers best practices for creating effective prompts for LLMs:

- **Version-Controlled Templates**: 
  - *What it means*: Track changes to prompts over time.
  - *How to implement*: Store prompts in version-controlled files rather than hardcoding them.
  - *Example*: Keep prompts in YAML files that are checked into Git.
  - *Why it matters*: Allows tracking prompt performance over time and rolling back problematic changes.

- **Context Optimization**: 
  - *What it means*: Efficiently provide necessary information to LLMs.
  - *How to implement*: Structure prompts to include relevant information without wasting tokens.
  - *Example*: Instead of sending entire documents, extract and summarize the most relevant sections.
  - *Why it matters*: Improves response quality and reduces token usage and latency.

- **Testable Prompts**: 
  - *What it means*: Objectively evaluate prompt effectiveness.
  - *How to implement*: Create test cases with expected outputs for prompts.
  - *Example*: Test a summarization prompt against various input texts and verify the outputs meet quality criteria.
  - *Why it matters*: Ensures prompt changes actually improve system performance.

- **Reusable Components**: 
  - *What it means*: Create templates for common prompt patterns.
  - *How to implement*: Develop a library of prompt fragments that can be composed together.
  - *Example*: Have standard templates for "act as an expert in X" or "analyze this text for Y".
  - *Why it matters*: Promotes consistency and best practices across prompts.
